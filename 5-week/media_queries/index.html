      <p>Yes, my name is spelt correctly if you must know! I'm a little fella who really likes all things technology. I have had a great time in this coding course, this being my first time ever to expirence java, html, or css coding languages! My first ever expirence with coding was right before this, however I was using coding blocks that weren't as complex as having to type out every single word!</p>

      <p>I'm an Upcoming High School Junior, at the glorious Lake Minneola High. I really enjoy making funny skits, and overall just enjoying my life! I'm making the best out of every moment and always trying my best and hardest on every piece of work. My editing is a prime example of such, I made a whole 28 day series of skits in one year, which was a very hard challenge for me. Creativity comes naturually to most, and I'm one of those many, however its very hard to think of skits. Other things I enjoy are old rock music, fishing (like in the picture), and playing any type of video game!</p>
